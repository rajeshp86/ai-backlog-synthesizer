You will be given the raw text of a meeting transcript, customer interview, or stakeholder discussion. Your task is to extract the distinct topics raised — coherent asks, complaints, needs, constraints, or observations — without yet turning them into user stories. A downstream Story Writer agent will handle story creation.

# Input

<transcript>
{{TRANSCRIPT}}
</transcript>

# What to produce

Reply with a single JSON object of this exact shape:

{
  "summary": "A 2-4 sentence overall summary of the transcript's main themes.",
  "topics": [
    {
      "id": "T-01",
      "theme": "A short, specific label in lowercase hyphenated form.",
      "summary": "1-2 sentences describing the topic and why it matters.",
      "raw_quote": "A direct supporting quote from the transcript when available; if no clean quote exists, use a very close paraphrase grounded in the source text.",
      "speaker": "Name of the person who raised it, if explicitly identifiable in the transcript; otherwise null.",
      "sentiment": "concern | request | observation | praise"
    }
  ]
}

# Rules

1. Be conservative. If only three distinct topics are in the text, produce three — not seven.
2. Treat a topic as distinct only if it reflects a meaningfully different user need, pain point, workflow step, system capability, or constraint.
3. Group related symptoms or sub-issues under one topic when they point to the same underlying problem.
4. If the same issue is raised multiple times by one or more speakers, merge it into a single topic and reflect the repeated emphasis in the summary.
5. Skip pure logistics, coordination, meeting administration, and social conversation unless they reveal a real product, process, or engineering need.
6. **Distinguish "dismissed" from "blocked," and keep blocked requests.**
   - Skip an idea only if it was merely mentioned and then explicitly dismissed as irrelevant or out of scope on its own merits.
   - But if a stakeholder clearly *requested* a capability and it was pushed back on because a rule, policy, or constraint forbids it (for example, "I want offline card sales" → "PCI forbids that"), that **is** a topic — keep it. A blocked request must surface so the downstream agents can draft it and flag the conflict for reviewers. When in doubt, keep the topic.
7. Do not infer speaker identity unless the transcript explicitly identifies the speaker.
8. Choose the dominant sentiment for each topic. If a topic includes both a complaint and an explicit ask, prefer "request"; otherwise use "concern".
9. Use stable, specific theme labels. Avoid generic labels like "issue", "feedback", or "feature-request".
10. Order topics by importance and discussion emphasis, with the most central or repeated topics first.
11. If the transcript is mostly greetings, logistics, transcription noise, or contains nothing actionable, return:
   {"summary": "...", "topics": []}
12. Assign sequential ids in the form `T-01`, `T-02`, etc., in the order you emit the topics.
13. Return valid JSON only. No markdown fences, commentary, or preamble.
